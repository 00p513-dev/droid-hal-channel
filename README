droid-hal-device
================

1. Build your Droid HAL (source build/envsetup.sh; brunch $DEVICE; mka ...)
2. Clone this repository as "rpm/" inside your Droid HAL build tree
3. "cd" into your Droid HAL build tree
4. Run "rpm/build-from-android" - this should auto-detect the device you are
   building for and pick the right .spec file for your device and run it
   through mb2, with some sanity checks (does the spec file exist? does the
   out/ directory for that device exist? etc..)
5. This should leave you with RPM packages in rpm/RPMS/droid-hal-$DEVICE-*.rpm
6. Continue by uploading to OBS, see obs-upload/README for instructions
